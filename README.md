This is a mini project for my college. 
The program is directly converted to an executable file, hence this can't be used for further development.
Feel free to download and use it.

## Note: 
1. There are bugs so use at your own risk.
2. The buttons are working good, the problem is when its clicked it will not show any actions.
3. Before closing, first `Unblock` and then close the application. 

## Requirments: ##
* Windows Operating System

## How to Use:
1. [Download](https://github.com/harshitv-io/Simple-Website-Blocker-using-Python-GUI/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the whole code and make sure that all files are together.
2. Run the `main.exe` file.
3. Enjoy !
