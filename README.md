This is a mini project for my college. 
This python program was directly converted to an `.exe` file, hence this can't be used for further development.
Feel free to download and use it.

## Note: 
1. There are bugs so use at your own risk.
2. The buttons are working good, the problem is when its clicked it will not show any actions.
3. Before closing, first `Unblock` and then close the application. 

## Requirments: ##
* Windows Operating System

## How to Use:
1. [Download](https://github.com/harshitv-io/Simple-Website-Blocker-using-Python-GUI/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract the code into a folder.
2. Run the `main.exe` file.
3. Add the websites to blacklisted in this syntax: `www.yourdomainname` (eg. `www.facebook.com`)
4. Now block and unblock websites using the buttons. (Note: Before closing, first `Unblock` and then close the application.)
6. Enjoy !
